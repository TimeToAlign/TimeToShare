/**
 * @timetoalign/timetoshare: the TimeToShare schema, generated types, a
 * validator, the complete and minimal forms, lossless reading and writing,
 * and the font that measures a drawing's text.
 *
 * A TimeToShare manifest is one JSON object holding the version marker
 * `timetoshare` and an array of root timelines, each describing a musical
 * timeline as timetoalign serializes it, optionally named, optionally
 * attributing timelines to groups and optionally styled for drawing. An
 * editor can place many manifests on a canvas, but a manifest knows nothing
 * about where or how often it is placed.
