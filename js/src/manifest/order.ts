/**
 * The canonical order and the standard writer of a TimeToShare manifest.
 *
 * Every array of a manifest whose order carries no meaning has one canonical
 * order: `timelines` by id; in every timeline, `children` by offset, then id,
 * `conversion_maps` by id, `regions` by start, then end, then id,
 * `flow_control` by coordinate, then id; `groups` by id and every group's `members` by
 * code point; `measure_maps` by id. Own-axis values compare by exact numeric
 * value, strings by Unicode code point. A `graphical.order` array is a
 * display order and is never re-ordered. Readers accept any order; `dumps` writes the canonical
 * one, every object's keys sorted by code point, two-space indentation and a
 * final newline, the same bytes as Python's `timetoshare.dumps`.
