"""The TimeToShare! schema, its fixtures, a validator and the font.

A TimeToShare manifest is one JSON object holding the version marker
``timetoshare`` and an array of root timelines, each describing a musical
timeline as timetoalign serializes it, optionally named, optionally
attributing timelines to groups and optionally styled for drawing. An editor
can place many manifests on a canvas, but a manifest knows nothing about
where or how often it is placed.
