"""Bundle the repository-level files into the package.

The schema, fixture, font and documentation directories and the README live
at the repository root, beside ``python/``, so that one copy serves the Python
package, the npm package and the fixture script. A static ``force-include``
cannot reach them when the wheel is built from the sdist (hatchling raises
``FileNotFoundError`` for a missing source), so two hooks resolve them at build
time:

* ``AssetsHook`` (build hook): in a repository checkout, the root
  ``schema/``, ``fixtures/``, ``fonts/`` and ``docs/`` directories go into the
  sdist under ``src/timetoshare/`` and into the wheel under ``timetoshare/``,
  and the root ``README.md`` goes into the sdist. In an unpacked sdist those copies
  are ordinary package files and need no forcing. The root ``LICENSE`` goes
  into the sdist root and into the wheel's ``.dist-info/licenses/``. In an
  unpacked sdist it is the project's own ``LICENSE``, which hatchling's default
  licence-file pattern already puts there.
* ``ReadmeHook`` (metadata hook): fills the dynamic ``readme`` field from the
  root ``README.md`` in a checkout, or from the sdist's copy.

Nothing is ever written into the source tree.
