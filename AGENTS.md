# Contributor Rules

These rules apply to every contributor, human or automated.

## Repository layout

- `schema/`: the JSON Schema of the current version, one document
  `<version>/timetoshare.schema.json` describing the one manifest shape
  `{timetoshare, timelines, id?, name?, meta?, groups?, measure_maps?,
  graphical?}`; it is the format contract and source of truth.
- `docs/`: `drawing.md`, the specification of the style cascade, layout,
  the block of frames, cards and bands (the boxes) that draws every
  manifest, and SVG and TikZ writers; it is part of the contract, and both
  packages ship it.
- `fixtures/`: generated manifests under `fixtures/<version>/`, each in the
  complete form beside its minimal twin (the subdirectories `groups/` and
  `bundles/` sort them by content only), hand-authored rejection cases
  under `fixtures/rejections/<version>/`, hand-authored warning cases under
  `fixtures/warnings/<version>/`, and the drawings (`inputs.json`,
  `figure.svg` and `figure.tex` per drawing; the hand-derived `figure.svg`
  files are listed with their arithmetic in `drawings/README.md`, everything
  else is emitted); see `fixtures/README.md`.
- `fonts/`: DejaVu Sans 2.37, its licence, and the advance-width metrics used
  by the drawing.
- `python/`: the PyPI package, tests, lockfile, and build configuration.
- `js/`: the npm package, generated TypeScript types, tests, and lockfile.
- `scripts/`: fixture emission, font-metrics extraction, and the check
  that every version declaration agrees.
- `decisions/`: numbered MADR decision records.
- `.github/workflows/`: continuous integration and the release automation,
  which publishes both packages and the schema document on both sites.

## Rules

- Work schema-first: change the versioned schema, then both packages, then
  fixtures.
- Add a numbered MADR in `decisions/` before adding a dependency. It must
  compare the dependency with writing the component here, record long-term
  maintenance cost, name the audited version, and include a review date.
- Do not add speculative options or dependencies.
- Package manifests declare compatible dependency ranges for published
  consumers. Lockfiles pin exact audited versions. A dependency may enter only
  after its selected release has been available for at least 14 days.
- Write tests README-first: update the relevant `tests/README.md` with what
  proves the behavior, then implement tests with exact expected values.
- Emit the manifests under `fixtures/<version>/` only through
  `scripts/emit_fixtures.py`; never hand-edit them. The script refuses to
  overwrite the fixtures of a version whose `v<version>` tag exists. Emit
  the drawings under `fixtures/<version>/drawings/` only through
  TimeLineEditor's `emit-drawings` script, which never rewrites the
  hand-derived figures but compares them with its own output.
- `docs/drawing.md` pins the drawing. There is no drawing schema, and a drawing's JSON form is internal to
  an implementation. A rule a reader could not reproduce from the
  specification alone is a defect of the specification. This repository never
  depends on TimeLineEditor in code or packages; only the emitted drawing
  figures are produced by TimeLineEditor's writers (its `emit-drawings`
  script, writing into a TimeToShare checkout).
- Write every fixture, rejection case and warning case with the standard writer
  `dumps` of either package: object keys sorted by code point at every depth,
  arrays in canonical order, two-space indentation, final newline, and floats
  spelled as Python's `repr`. Never keep a fixed list of key orders; key order
  is sorted order, and `canonical_order` covers only the order of array
  elements. In JavaScript, read
  files with `parse` or `parseJson`, never `JSON.parse`, and write
  them with `dumps` or `compactJson`, never `JSON.stringify`; the native
  methods lose the distinction between `2.0` and `2`, integers beyond 2^53,
  and the order of array-index keys.
- Author rejection cases under `fixtures/rejections/` by hand, one rule per
  case, and warning cases under `fixtures/warnings/` by hand; the fixture
  script emits neither.
- Regenerate `js/src/generated/` after changing the schema or font metrics.
  The generated TypeScript files belong in this repository.
- Regenerate `fonts/dejavu-sans-2.37.metrics.json` with
  `scripts/extract_font_metrics.py`; do not calculate or edit its advances by
  hand.
- Support the current version only. Both packages validate the current
  schema version and refuse every other; there are no migrations. A version
  a later one replaces lives in the git history at its tag and in its
  released packages.
